# CLI Based Restaurant Management System
A project that I made in class 12th for my final exams.

It uses MySQL for backend

Uses the modules random, mysql-connector-python, date and time


It has 2 options : <br>
a) Delivery : User can choose from the menu and select items to be added/removed from the cart, and then checkout using several payment methods <br>
b) Reservation : User can choose to reserve seats at the restaurant, time to be chosen, type of seat etc. and dine accordingly.
